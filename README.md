# nb-control - Narrow Band System Control Modules

This repository contains the modules and scripts for controlling the narrow band system scan procedure.

The direct-conversion (DC) receiver control relies on the manufacturer's Linear Lab Tools for Python 2.7.

To maintain compatibility, the rest of the modules are also on Python 2.7.

Modules were written for Windows OS.

---
*UPDATE 2024:*  Python 2.7 is now deprecated and this has since led to issues, specially with VS Code capabilities. The code is still functional, but it needs extra care.
---

# Installation Instructions (installation order not strict)

## 1.0) Install Anaconda

Instructions can be found on:

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Current Anaconda builds use Python 3 by default and it is recommended to install the latest version.

A virtual environment using Python 2.7 will be used.

### 1.1) Download the `nb-control` package

Download and unpack the folder in the desired location.

### 1.2) Environment

These modules use Python 2.7 with a conda virtual environment whose packages list is stored in the `narrowband.yml` file, found in the `env/` folder.

Open the Anaconda Prompt with administrator rights.

To navigate to the correct folder:

``` cd/```

``` cd Your-Path-Here/nb-control/env/```

To create/install the specified environment:

``` conda env create -f narrowband.yml ```

If you perform changes afterwards, to export a modified environment with only the user selected packages:
``` conda env export --from-history > narrowband.yml ```

## 2.0) Install Code Editor (Visual Studio Code preferred)

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview

After installation, the Python extension should be installed.

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

### 2.1) Powershell (optional)

VSCode also suggests installing the latest Powershell Terminal (as of this writing, v7.1.4):

https://github.com/PowerShell/powershell/releases

For more information:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1

Afterwards, open Anaconda Prompt with administrator rights and perform:

```conda init```

Or else open Anaconda Powershell Prompt with administrator rights and perform:

```conda init powershell```

This should configure terminals such as Powershell to activate conda environments. More details on environments and terminals with VSCode:

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_environments-and-terminal-windows

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_configuration

Some further reading on the Anaconda with Python interaction:

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/python-vsc/

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments

Upon first use with a Python file, VSCode should ask you which interpreter and conda environment to use and you should select `Python 2.7.18 64-bit : ('narrowband' : conda)`.

## 3.0) Install Demo Board Software for Transmitter and Receiver

---
*UPDATE 2024:* These older drivers require disabling the security feature of Core Isolation Memory Integrity on Modern Windows (https://www.makeuseof.com/core-isolation-memory-integrity-windows/).
---

The Python modules require some drivers that are only downloaded to the computer with the presence of the demo board software and a recognized legitimate control board connected via USB.
### 3.1) QuikEval and PLLWizard (Frequency Synthesizer Demo Board DC1705C for LTC6946)

Should be installed before plugging in the DC590B control board through the USB port.

Download and install the QuikEval™ driver package:

https://ltspice.analog.com/software/ltcqev.exe

Run the exe file and follow instructions.

---
*UPDATE 2024:* Separate installation of .NET 3.5 seems required to make the drivers work on modern Windows (10/11):
---

https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=22

For the PLLWizard, there are two possibilites:

* If you have .NET >= 2.0 already installed or want the latest version to download directly from Microsoft:

http://swdownloads.analog.com/pllwizard/pllwizardsetup.exe

The version with .NET 2.0 included does not work on modern Windows (10/11)

~~* If you don't have .NET 2.0 installed, this file includes it:~~

~~http://swdownloads.analog.com/pllwizard/pllwizardsetup_withnet20.exe~~

However the pllwizardsetup.exe is recommended for current Windows machines, because a more recent .NET version is most likely installed.

Download and install PLLWizard.

After installation, the PLLWizard program should be opened with the frequency synthesizer plugged in via USB and turned on.

This would ensure the appropriate drivers are present.

### 3.2) PScope (Direct Conversion Receiver Demo Board DC1513B for LTM9004)

Download and install the PScope™ software:

http://ltspice.analog.com/software/ltcps.exe

Similar to the transmitter steps, after installation, the PScope program should be opened with the DC receiver plugged in via USB and turned on.

This would ensure the appropriate drivers are present.

## 4.0) Install Linear Lab Tools (64-bit) for Python

DC receiver control requires this package from Linear Technology (now part of Analog Devices).

The modules expect the installation path to be:

```'%UserProfile%/Documents/linear_technology/linear_lab_tools64/'```

https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-development-platforms/linearlab-tools.html

https://www.analog.com/media/en/engineering-tools/design-tools/linearlabtools_python_install_instructions.pdf

## 5.0) Install STM32F4 Discovery Microcontroller Drivers (Used for Switching Matrix Control)

The STM32F4 microcontroller drivers need to be installed before connecting it to the computer.

**Warning:** The ST manufacturer website requires registration for downloading software tools.

The ST-LINK/V2-A USB driver can be downloaded from:

https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-utilities/stsw-link009.html#

After installation, for the first use it is also recommended to connect the programming USB cable (Mini-USB) to the computer along the command USB cable (Micro-USB).

Subsequent uses only require the command USB cable (Micro-USB).

### 5.1) Optional for further development with the STM32F4 - STM32Cube

For more advanced development requirements, there is the STM32Cube package (not necessary for our modules):

https://www.st.com/content/my_st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages/stm32cubef4.license=1628806269803.product=Patch-CubeF4.version=1.26.2.html#

Also on Github:

https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeF4

# Use with VSCode

*Update 2024:* There are issues when using the deprecated Python 2.7. The best way to circumvent this is to run the scripts directly with the Anaconda prompt or command terminal.

 I did not succeed in making VS Code work fully, although it might still be possible with further tinkering. One of the first things to do is install an older version of the Python plugin (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72214043/how-to-debug-python-2-7-code-with-vs-code):

* Open the Extensions pane from the bar on the left and find Python
* Click on the gear icon and select "Install another version"
* Choose 2021.9.1246542782.
* After it's finished, restart VS Code or CTRL+Shift+P Reload Window.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50202829/how-do-i-get-vscode-to-run-python-2-7-13-instead-of-python-3-6
---

Open a new workspace and the folder `nb-control/`. Then open the file `scripts/narrow_band_system_script.py`.

The script should be configured in the `MeasParameters` dictionary and the `Phantom details - Reinforcing values` sections.

The script should be manually edited after each mesurement, by uncommenting the appropriate lines and commenting (with a `#`) the other lines in the calibration rounds and actual measurements lines. On VSCode for Windows, keyboard shortcut for commenting in Python is `CTRL + /`.

Before running the script, the USB hub should be connected between computer and narrowband system. The latter also needs to be powered on (**ATTENTION** to the voltages!).

To run the file in terminal, either click on the play button in the top-right side of the editor or
right-click anywhere in the editor window and select 'Run Python file in terminal'.

Please refer to the Narrowband_System_User_Guide.pdf document for more details on the hardware and measurement procedure.
